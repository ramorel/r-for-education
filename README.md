# R for Educational Research: A Guide for Humans (and other creatures)


**Purpose**: To introduce to education researchers to R as a tool for data collection, analysis, and reporting.

## Overview

R has become an increasingly popular language, not just for statistical analysis (as it was designed for), but for all manner of data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting. While R is not a general programming language, like Python or C++, it is surprisingly flexible and should statisfy the needs of just about every researcher focusing on education. If, like me, you were trained in a proprietary statistical environment (Stata for me, which I still use from time to time), I suspect that I will not need to convince you of the usefulness of R compared to Python, etc., but to convince you that the time you need to invest to learn R is worth it and that there is much value-added over and above software like Stata, SPSS, and SAS. At bare minimum, R is free and open-source. Pros and cons here, I know, and I will address those. But ultimately, R is more flexible, more extensive, allows you to do more things, is more transparent, and a great joy to use compared to major proprietary statistical software.

When I first learned R, as a doctoral student at Northwestern University working on a social network project, I kept my evangelizing to a minimum. My classmates and I were all trained to use Stata and Stata served (most of) our purposes (more or less) perfectly. I figured if your work is dominant by regression analysis of a single dataset with limited data wrangling, Stata is a great tool and meets the accepted standards of the field. So, I decided _not_ to be that annoying _guy_ who talks about how much he loves R and how much better than Stata R is. It just did not serve my purposes--I needed to do network analysis!

I still think that one should _not_ be that annoying _guy_ who chimes in (without prompting) with wild-eyed rants asserting that R is better than [random piece of statistical software]. That's--_annoying and not helpful_. However, I also think that almost anyone doing educational research will benefit from learning R and using it for the bulk of their work. Even if your work consists of bread-and-butter regression analysis of simple 2D datasets, I believe that using R will improve your work and give you much more functionality besides.

The purpose for this text is to provide a guided introduction to R, designed for researchers interested in transitioning from proprietary software like Stata and for new reseachers learning about statistical programming for the first time, with a specific focus on education research.

## The Case for R

Why R? There is steeper learning curve than other statistical software--mostly because of the lack of a point-and-click interface. Opening vanilla R for the frist time is intimidating for non-programmers. Launch R and you see a `<` with a blinking cursor next to it. And that's it. This is alleviated a bit by the popular R IDE (_integrated development environment_) from [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
